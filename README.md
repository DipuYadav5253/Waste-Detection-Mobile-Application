# ♻️ Waste Detection Mobile App

The **Waste Detection App** is an Android application powered by machine learning that helps users identify and classify different types of waste using their smartphone camera. The goal is to promote better waste segregation and environmentally-friendly disposal practices by distinguishing between recyclable, organic, and non-recyclable materials.

## 🌟 Features

- 📸 Real-time object detection using camera
- 🖼️ Image capture mode for detecting waste in photos
- 🧠 ML model classifies waste into categories (e.g., plastic, paper, organic, etc.)
- ♻️ Helps promote sustainable waste disposal
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast performance on mobile devices

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Android Studio**
- **Java / Kotlin**
- **TensorFlow Lite** (for on-device ML)
- **CameraX API** (for real-time detection)
- **ML Model** trained on waste classification dataset

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DipuYadav5253/Waste-Detection-App.git
   
2.Open in Android Studio

3.Make sure you have:

    Android device/emulator with CameraX support
    
    Required camera permissions
    
    TensorFlow Lite model placed in the assets directory

4.Build and run the app on your device.

🔐 Permissions Required

    .CAMERA
    
    .READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (for image detection mode)

🤖 How It Works

    1. Launch the app and choose between:
    
    📹 Live Detection (uses your camera in real-time)
    
    🖼️ Capture Mode (analyze an image from gallery or camera)
    
    2. The app runs a trained ML model to classify the detected object.
    
    3. Results show the type of waste and disposal suggestions.

🔧 Future Features
    🗺️ Map integration to find nearby recycling centers
    
    📊 Detection history and analytics
    
    🧠 Improved ML model accuracy with custom datasets
    
    ☁️ Firebase sync for cloud tracking
